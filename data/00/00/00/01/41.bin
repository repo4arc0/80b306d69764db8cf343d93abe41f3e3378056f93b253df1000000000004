早在光出现之前  世界是一片黑暗
Long before the birth of light, there was darkness,

17
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,960
那黑暗孕育了黑暗精灵
and from that darkness came the Dark Elves.

18

一千年前
Millennia ago

19
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:48,850
最残暴的黑暗精灵  马勒基斯
the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith,

20
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,050
企图将我们的宇宙
sought to transform our universe

21
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,760
重归于无尽黑夜
back into one of eternal night.

22
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:58,050
要实现这邪恶的计划
Such evil was possible

23
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,150
他必须借助以太粒子的力量
through the power of the Aether,

24
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,260
那是能带来无限毁灭的古老武器
an ancient force of infinite destruction.

25
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:08,840
马勒基斯
Malekith.

26
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,430
阿斯加德的军队攻来了
Asgard's forces are upon us.

27
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,240
阿斯加德的圣军
The noble of armies of Asgard,

28
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:23,300
在我父亲包尔王的率领下
led by my father, King Bor,

29
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,690
对这些邪恶的生灵发起了伟大的战争
waged a mighty war against these creatures.

30
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,800
派出诅咒战士
Send in the Kursed!

31
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:59,370
九大王国的汇聚渐渐形成
As the nine worlds converged above him

32
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,620
马勒基斯终于可以释放以太粒子
Malekith could at last unleash the Aether.

33
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,860
但阿斯加德从他手上夺走了那武器
But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp.

34
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:29,490
没了武器  黑暗精灵就此战败
Without it, the Dark Elves fell.

35
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:45,630
尽管大势已去
With the battle all but lost

36
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,410
马勒基斯仍不惜牺牲他的部下
Malekith sacrificed his own people

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,760
妄图与阿斯加德军队同归于尽
in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army.

38
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:57,720
消灭他们  我们才能生存
Their deaths will mean our survival.

39
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,090
这场战争还远没有结束
This war is far from over.

40
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,760
马勒基斯被击败
Malekith was vanquished,

41
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,860
以太粒子也被摧毁
and the Aether was no more.

42
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,660
至少我们以为是这样
Or so we were led to believe...

43
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:22,250
陛下  是否要摧毁以太粒子
Sire, the Aether, shall we destroy it?

44
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:27,120
只可惜它的力量太过强大  我们无法摧毁
If only we could, but its power is too great.

45
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,520
将它深埋
Bury it deep.

46
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:32,940
藏在没人能找到的地方
Somewhere no one will ever find it.

你好  母亲
Hello, mother.

51
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,650
你为我骄傲吗
Have I made you proud.

52
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,680
求求你  别让事情变得更糟
Please, don't make this worse.

53
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,970
怎样才算更糟
Define "worse".

54
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,260
够了
Enough!

55
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,110
我要单独跟犯人谈谈
 I will speak to the prisoner alone.

56
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,820
何必要如此大惊小怪啊
I really don't see what all the fuss is about.

57
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:48,020
你还没认识到你罪行的严重性吗
Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes?

58
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:53,110
你所到之处  战争  毁灭与死亡随至
Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death.

59
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,750
我是作为仁慈的神去米德加德
I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth

60
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,430
统治地球人民
as a benevolent god,

61
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,930
就像你一样
just like you.

62
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,000
我们不是神
We are not gods.

63
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,020
我们跟人类一样  出生  生活然后死去
We are born, we live, we die, just as humans do.

64
00:05:07,630 --> 00:05:09,480
但是我们能活五千年
Give or take five thousand years.

65
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,150
这一切都是因为你想要王位
All this because Loki desires a throne.

66
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,540
这是我与生俱来的权利
It's my birthright!

67
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,800
你与生俱来的权利
Your birthright

68
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,670
是一出生
was to die...

69
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,760
就死去
as a child!

70
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,370
你本被丢弃在冰冷的岩石上
Cast out onto a frozen rock.

71
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:28,260
如果不是我当时收留了你
If I had not taken you in

72
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,610
此刻你就不会站在这里憎恨我
you would not be here now to hate me.

73
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,820
如果我该被处死  那发发慈悲
If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake,

74
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,850
赶紧动手吧
just swing it.

75
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,720
我并非不喜欢和你谈话
It's not that I don't love our little talks,

76
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,940
只是...
it's just...

77
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:42,940
我的确不喜欢
I don't love them.

78
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,970
你还活着  完全是因为弗丽嘉不忍杀你
Frigga is the only reason you are still alive

79
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:47,540
你以后休想再见她了
and you will never see her again.

80
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,360
你会在地牢里度过余生
You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.

81
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:56,720
那托尔呢
And what of Thor?

82
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,000
我在牢里关到死  你却要封那个蠢货为王吗
You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains?

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,960
托尔必须尽力弥补你造成的损害
Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done,

84
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:08,290
他将恢复九大王国的秩序  之后
he will bring order to the nine Realms and then,

85
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:11,460
是的  他会成为王
yes, he will be king.

Anyone else?

00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:45,030
也许下次我们该直接拿块头大的下手
Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.

95
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,320
接下来去哪
Where do we go next?

Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms.

你该留下
You should stay here

be with your people where your heart is,

迟点回阿斯加德也无妨
Asgard can wait.

多谢你了
You have my thanks.

101

As you have mine.

As are Nornheim and Ria.

106
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:18,980

Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.

你一定把我当成一块面包了

that needs to be buttered so heavily.

我不是这个意思
That was not my intent.

110

彩虹桥被毁之后  这是九大王国
For the first time since Bifrost was destroyed,

111
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:30,410
第一次重归安宁
the Nine Realms are at peace.

112
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:33,130
他们会因此记起我们的强大
They're well reminded of our strength

113

而你也赢得了他们的敬意和我的感激
and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.

Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.

这与简·福斯特无关  父王
This isn't about Jane Foster, father.

117

人类的生命转瞬即逝  不值得挂心
Human lives are fleeting, they're nothing.

118
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,030
你该好好珍惜眼前人
You'd be better served by what lies in front of you.

我说这话  不是以众神之父的身份
I'm telling you this not as the All-father,

而是以父亲的身份
but as your father.

差点挑起了第二次战役
so much that you nearly started the second.

谁让第一仗那么过瘾呢

No, this is one I set myself.

00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,350
一言难尽
It's complicated.

148
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:43,710
他还在你身边吗
Is he still around?

149
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,200
不  他
No, he...

150
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,320
走了
went away.

151
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,350
我也经历过
I've been there.

152
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,280
心爱的人离开是很痛苦的事  不是吗
The going away. It's hard, isn't it?

153
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,940
我以前交往过一个女人  她去纽约工作了
I was seeing a woman and uh...she took a job in New York,

154
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,060
最终感情敌不过距离
eventually the distance killed it.

155
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,760
还有就是...
And...and the fact that she uh...

156
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,760
她一直跟别的男人上床
she kept sleeping with other dudes.

157
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,300
-不是吧  -好多呢
- No! - Oh, so many.

158
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,750
能给我们上点红酒吗
Could we get some wine please?

159
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:07,710
好啊  我也想来点
Sure, I'd love some.

160
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,920
理查德  这是达西
Richard, this is Darcy.

161
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,440
你来干什么
What are you doing here?

162
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,280
你好
Oh, hello.

163
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:19,230
我去了实验室也就是你妈家
So, I show up to work at the lab/your mom's house,

164
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:22,840
满心以为会看到你穿着睡衣在屋里晃悠
fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas

165
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:26,170
吃着冰激凌  念念不忘...那个谁
eating ice cream obsessing about... you know who...

166
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:29,450
可你居然没有  你穿上了淑女装
But you're not! You're wearing lady clothes,

167
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,260
甚至还洗了澡  对吧  香喷喷的
you even showered, didn't you? You smell good.

168
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,390
有什么事
Is there a point to all this,

169
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,530
你跑到这儿来找我一定有什么要紧事
because there really needs to be a point to all this.

170
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,080
对
Right.

171
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,720
还记得你被你丢在一边的科学仪器吗
You know all that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore?

172
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:41,210
你现在得开始看了
You might wanna start looking at it again.

173
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:43,520
我们大老远跑来就是为了这个
This is the reason we came all the way out here.

174
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,690
出故障了
It's malfunctioning.

175
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,980
我也这么觉得
That's what I said.

176
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,730
我也这么做的
That's what I did!

177
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,850
还以为你做事会更科学点
I thought you'd do something a little more scientific.

178
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,520
-应该没什么问题  -嗯...
- I'm sure it's nothing. - Yeah, it's...

179
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,870
看起来不像没问题
It doesn't look like nothing.

180
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,680
有点像艾瑞克之前念叨的那些读数
Kind of looks like the readings that Erik was rambling about.

181
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,710
我们的朋友艾瑞克  他有点疯了
Our friend Erik, kind of went banana-balls.

182
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:00,590
他没兴趣
He's not interested.

183
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,890
-我有兴趣  -我也没兴趣
- I'm interested. - I'm not interested.

184
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:02,920
你可以走了
It's time for you to go now.

185
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:05,710
好吧
Okay.

186
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,270
短暂但愉快
Short but sweet.

187
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:11,400
她该吃药了
She needs help.

188
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,280
我还是点份鲈鱼吧
I think I'm gonna have the sea bass.

189
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:19,420
鲈鱼  嗯  鲈鱼不错
Sea bass. Yeah, sea bass is good.

190
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,850
鲈鱼  鲈鱼  鲈鱼  鲈鱼
Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass,

191
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:27,700
鲈鱼  鲈鱼  鲈鱼  鲈鱼...
sea bass, sea bass, sea bass...sea bass. Sea bass...

192
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:30,620
-鲈鱼  -简
- Sea bass. - Jane,

193
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,920
你还是别念叨鲈鱼了
maybe you should stop saying "sea bass"

194
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,530
跟你朋友走吧
and go after your friend.

195
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,260
午餐很愉快
This was so fun.

196
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:39,220
我就自己在这儿念叨鲈鱼吧
You know, I'll just stay here and say "Sea bass" alone.

197
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:48,330
我恨你
And I hate you.

198
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,580
怎么了  我都夸他了
What?! I said he was cute.

199
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,370
你还是闭嘴开车吧
Just shut up and drive.

200
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,570
下个路口左转
You need to take the next left.

201
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,220
他是谁
Who's he?

202
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,200
他是我的实习生
He's my intern.

203
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,550
你都有实习生了
You have an intern?

204
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:08,450
没错
Oh, yeah.

205
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,760
你好  福斯特博士
Hello, Dr. Foster. It's uh...

206
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,780
能与你共事真是太荣幸了
It's such a great honor to be working with you.

207
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,900
好吧  我得打给艾瑞克
Right. I need to call Erik.

208
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:16,640
右转
Oh, uh...take a right.

209
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,080
再左转
And a left.

210
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:24,950
在伦敦开车我已经驾轻就熟了
I have totally mastered driving in London.

211
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:28,540
喂  艾瑞克  还是我  你在哪
Hi, Erik, it's me again. Where are you?

212
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:30,380
我过来是因为你说你有发现
I came here because you said you were onto something

213
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,600
结果你却消失了
and then you vanish.

214
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,260
我现在在巨石阵
I'm here at Stonehenge,

215
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,660
对今天发生的一则趣闻进行跟踪报道
for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today.

216
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,990
警方于今天上午11点刚过时
The police were called to the scene

217
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,850
接到报警  赶到现场
shortly after 11 a.m. this morning,

218
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:43,370
一名看似正常的男游客来到这里
after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area

219
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,330
随即开始裸奔
then, decided to strip naked

220
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:49,070
并举着科学仪器  吓坏了游客
and effectively terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment

221
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:51,570
嘴里喊着他是想救他们
while shouting that he was trying to save them.

222
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:54,600
此人随后被证实为著名天文物理学家
The man later identified as noted astrophysicist

223
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,770
艾瑞克·塞尔维格博士
Dr. Erik Selvig

224
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:58,290
他目前已被警方拘留待审
has been called in for questioning by police.

225
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,680
快走  多令人激动啊
Come on, this is exciting!

226
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,260
看  实习生都激动了
Look, the intern is excited.

227
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,050
我叫伊恩
"Ian".

228
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,730
要带上相位表吗
Do you want the phase meter?

229
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:09,440
-不要  -拿上相位表
- No. - Bring the phase meter.

230
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,260
长得像面包机的那个
The toaster-looking thing.

231
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:13,410
我知道相位表长什么样
Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.

232
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:24,160
这手机的铃声要怎么换
How do I change the ringtone on this thing?

233
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,110
有三个学位的天文物理学家
An astrophysicist with three degrees

234
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:28,020
应该会自己换铃声
should be able to change her own ringtone.

235
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,020
为什么要打电话
Why are you calling me?

236
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,060
我不想大喊大叫
I didn't want to shout.

237
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:31,300
实习生说往这边走
Intern says it's this way.

238
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,380
伊恩  我叫伊恩
"Ian". My name is Ian.

239
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:51,170
我可不想因为搞个科学被人捅死
I am not getting stabbed in the name of science.

240
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:52,850
没事的  我们是美国人
It's okay, we're Americans!

241
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,530
这样说他们就会喜欢我们了吗
Is that supposed to make them like us?

242
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,370
他们能把它弄走
They'll make it go away.

243
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,700
只是孩子
Oh, they're kids.

244
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,890
你们是警察吗
Are you the police?

245
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:06,040
不  我们是科学家  我是
No, we're scientists. Well, I am.

246
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,970
-谢谢  -我们无意中发现的
- Thanks. - We just found it.

247
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,780
能带我们去看看吗
Can you show us?

248
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,970
这可不太正常
That doesn't seem right.

249
00:18:57,910 --> 00:18:58,840
去哪了
Where'd it go?

250
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,450
这真是...
That's...

251
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,230
太不可思议了
that's incredible.

252
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:29,940
怎么回事
What happened?

253
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:33,570
有时候能回来  有时候回不来
Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't.

254
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,120
我也想丢个东西  简  把你的鞋给我
I want to throw something. Jane, give me your shoe.

255
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,910
我上次见到这样的读数还是在...
I haven't seen readings like this since...

256
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,460
在...
since...

257
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,480
新墨西哥吗
New Mexico?

258
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:52,360
什么都别碰
Don't touch anything!

259
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,760
把你的鞋给我
Give me your shoe.

260
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,530
那是车钥匙吗
Were those the car keys?

261
00:20:58,830 --> 00:20:59,940
达西
Darcy!

262
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,870
以太粒子唤醒了我们
The Aether awakens us.

263
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:05,580
天体汇聚又开始了
The Convergence returns.

264
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:22,550
你来迟了
You're late.

265
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:27,430
有时欢庆比战斗更累人
Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle.

266
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,420
那你一定有一样没做对
Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.

267
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,360
也许吧
Perhaps.

268
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,880
繁星都还好吗
How fare the stars?

269
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,650
一如既往地闪烁着
Still shining.

270
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:39,220
我在这儿能看到九个王国和亿万生灵
From here I can see nine realms and ten trillion souls.

271
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:46,270
记得我跟你说过的天体汇聚吗
Do you recall what I told you of the Convergence?

272
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,450
记得  各个王国连成一线
Yes, the alignment of the worlds.

273
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,350
快要到来了  是吗
It approaches, doesn't it?

274
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:53,630
这宇宙奇观上一次出现
The universe hasn't seen this marvel

275
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:55,740
是在我守卫开始之前了
since before my watch began.

276
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:59,820
很少有人能感觉到  能看到的更少了
Few can sense it, even fewer can see it.

277
00:24:01,870 --> 00:24:04,000
虽然它可能带来危险
But while its effects can be dangerous,

278
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:07,260
但真是美极了
it is truly beautiful.

279
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,120
我什么也看不到
I see nothing.

280
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:14,110
也许是因为那不是你想看的美景
Or perhaps that is not the beauty you seek.

281
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,810
她怎么样
How is she?

282
00:24:21,490 --> 00:24:23,370
你的凡人还挺聪明
She's quite clever, your mortal.

283
00:24:23,370 --> 00:24:24,610
她自己还不知道
She doesn't know it yet,

284
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,740
但她也在研究天体汇聚
but she studies the Convergence as well.

285
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,340
甚至...
Even...

286
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:31,290
怎么了
What?

287
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,090
我看不到她了
I can't see her.

288
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:17,660
简
Jane!

289
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,460
你去哪了啊
Where the hell were you?

290
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,030
你不会报警了吧
Tell me you didn't call the police!

291
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:23,270
不然我该怎么办
What was I supposed to do?

292
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,340
别报警啊
Not call the police!

293
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,140
我急疯了
I was freaking out.

294
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,700
你报警  警察就会通知联调局
You call the cops, they tell the Feds,

295
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,510
紧接着神盾局就从天而降
the next thing you know we have S.H.I.E.L.D crawling all over,

296
00:25:28,510 --> 00:25:29,650
把这里变成51区
"Area 51-ing" the place.

297
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:32,430
-简  -我们发现了一个稳定的重力异常场
- Jane! - We had a stable gratification anomaly,

298
00:25:32,430 --> 00:25:33,860
并且能自由进行研究
We had unimpeded access.

299
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,730
我们唯一的竞争对手是十岁的孩子
Our only competition was ten years old!

300
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,530
简  你失踪了五个小时
Jane, you were gone for five hours!

301
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,250
什么
What?

302
00:25:46,610 --> 00:25:47,640
好诡异
That's weird.

303
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,630
总这样
Typical.

304
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,820
简
Jane.

305
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:18,420
抱歉  我必须确认下你是真的
Sorry. I just needed to make sure you were real,

306
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,000
今天真的好诡异
it's been a very strange day.

307
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,430
我是真的  简
Well, I am. Jane what...

308
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,550
你去哪了
Where were you?!

309
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,580
你又去哪了
Where were you?

310
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:26,910
海姆达尔看不到你
Heimdall could not see you.

311
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,840
我一直在原地等你
I was right here where you left me.

312
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,060
我一直在等你  后来我哭了
I was waiting and then I was crying

313
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:32,740
再后来我到处去找你
and then I went out looking for you.

314
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,880
你说你会回来的
You said you were coming back.

315
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,840
我知道  但是彩虹桥被毁了
I know, I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed.

316
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,590
九大王国爆发了战乱
The Nine Realms erupted into chaos,

317
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,070
战争肆虐  劫盗成群
wars were raging, marauders were pillaging.

318
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:43,200
我必须制止杀戮
I had to put an end to the slaughter.

319
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:48,060
这个理由倒是不坏
As excuses go, it's not terrible.

320
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,690
但我在电视上看见你了  你去了纽约啊
But I saw you on TV, you were...you were in New York!

321
00:26:52,090 --> 00:26:54,730
简  我那时努力保护你不受来自我的世界的侵害
Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world,

322
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:57,700
但我错了  我太傻了
but I was wrong, I was a fool.

323
00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:02,780
我相信是命运让我们走到一起
But I believe that fate brought us together.

324
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,100
简  我不知道你去了哪  发生了什么事
Jane, I don't know where you were or what happened,

325
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,430
但我很清楚一件事
but I do know this.

326
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:09,940
什么
What?

327
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,450
我知道
I know...

328
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:14,580
真的知道吗
You do?

329
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,330
知道什么
Do what?

330
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:18,840
什么
What?

331
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,390
是你干的吗
Is this you?

332
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,900
我们正忙着呢
We're kind of in the middle of something here.

333
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:33,090
我确定我们要被捕了
I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.

334
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:34,060
等一下
Hold that thought.

335
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,870
看看你
Look at you!

336
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:40,190
还是那么肌肉发达  宇宙怎么样
Still all muscly and everything. How's space?

337
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,720
挺好的
Space is fine.

338
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,530
打扰一下
Excuse me?

339
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:45,820
-你是简·福斯特吗  -是的
- Are you Jane Foster? - Yes.

340
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,000
你认识这个人吗
Do you know this man?

341
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:49,580
他是我的实习生
He's my intern.

342
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,680
我实习生的实习生
My intern's intern.

343
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,750
这里是私人领地
This is private property

344
00:27:52,750 --> 00:27:54,290
你们全都涉嫌非法入侵
and you're trespassing, the lot of you.

345
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:55,410
请你跟我们走一趟
You'll have to come with me.

346
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,920
简
Jane!

347
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,580
简
Jane?

348
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,530
托尔
Thor.

349
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,190
你没事吧
You alright?

350
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:08,110
刚刚怎么回事
What just happened?

351
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:10,590
把手放在头上  退后
Place your hands on your heads, step back!

352
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:11,910
这位女士不舒服
This woman is unwell.

353
00:28:11,910 --> 00:28:13,080
她很危险
She's dangerous.

354
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:14,840
我也是
So am I.

355
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,460
请求武警速到现场支援
Requesting armed response officers to the scene.

356
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,450
抱紧我
Hold on to me.

357
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,540
你要干什么
What are you doing?

358
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:30,540
我去
Holy shit!

359
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,560
我们得再来一次
We have to do that again.

360
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,810
欢迎来到阿斯加德
Welcome to Asgard.

361
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,650
{\pos(195,207)}瓦特海姆

362
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:30,660
瞧瞧我留下了什么  阿格姆
Look upon my legacy, Algrim.

363
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:34,810
我几乎记不得光明之前的日子了
I can barely remember a time before the light.

364
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:38,680
我们种族的延续将是你留给后世的遗产
Our survival will be your legacy.

365
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:44,350
我要让阿斯加德人尝尽我们吃的苦头
The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered.

366
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,690
我要拿回以太粒子
I will reclaim the Aether.

367
00:29:45,730 --> 00:29:47,020
我要恢复我们的世界
I will restore our world.

368
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,340
我要终结这饱受荼毒的宇宙
And I will put an end to this poisoned universe.

369
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,080
这是什么
What's that?

370
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:00,030
别动
Be still.

371
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,760
这不是地球上的物质  它是什么
This is not of Earth, what is it?

372
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:11,980
还不清楚
We do not know.

373
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:16,360
但她体内涌动的能量太大  她撑不住的
But she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her.

374
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,130
这是量子场发生器  对吗
That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?

375
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,680
这是灵魂冶炼炉
It's a Soul Forge.

376
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:30,510
灵魂冶炼炉能迁移分子能吗
Does a Soul Forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another?

377
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,420
是的
Yes.

378
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,320
就是量子场发生器
Quantum field generator.

379
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:40,360
我的话对你来说只是耳旁风吗
My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?

380
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,620
她病了
She's ill.

381
00:30:41,620 --> 00:30:42,790
她是凡人
She is mortal.

382
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:45,380
他们都会患病
Illness is their defining trait.

383
00:30:45,380 --> 00:30:47,080
我带她来是因为我们能救她
I brought her here because we can help her.

384
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,320
她不属于阿斯加德
She does not belong here in Asgard

385
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,630
如同山羊肉上不了宴会台面一样
anymore than a goat belongs at a banquet table.

386
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,000
他刚刚是说...
Did he just...?

387
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:56,280
你以为你是谁啊
Who do you think you are?

388
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:58,760
我是奥丁  阿斯加德国王
I'm Odin. King of Asgard.

389
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,940
九大王国的保护者
Protector of the Nine Realms.

390
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,270
我是...
Oh. Well, I'm...

391
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:06,090
我很清楚你是谁  简·福斯特
I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.

392
00:31:07,290 --> 00:31:08,840
你跟你爸提过我
You told your dad about me?

393
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,980
她体内有一些物质  父王
Something is within her, father,

394
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,130
我从没见过的物质
something I have not seen before.

395
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,670
她的星球有自己的治疗师  他们叫医生
Her world has its healers. They are called "doctors."

396
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:15,640
交给他们处理吧
Let them deal with it.

397
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:17,770
守卫  送她回米德加德
Guards, take her back to Midgard.

398
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,500
不  不要
No, I wouldn't...

399
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,640
碰她
...touch her.

400
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,210
简  你没事吧
Jane, are you alright?

401
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,300
这不可能
It's impossible.

402
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,410
她感染的东西在保护她
The infection, it's defending her.

403
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,290
不
No,

404
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,640
是在保护它自己
it's defending itself.

405
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,070
跟我来
Come with me.

406
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:46,410
有些东西的历史可以追溯到宇宙成形之前
There are relics that predate the universe itself.

407
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:50,550
她体内的东西  似乎就是这样的古物
What lies within her appears to be one of them.

408
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,780
九大王国并非永恒的
The Nine Realms are not eternal.

409
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:57,010
他们有诞生的黎明  也将有消逝的黄昏
They had a dawn as they will have a dusk.

410
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,450
但在那黎明之前  黑暗势力
But before that dawn the dark forces,

411
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:04,240
黑暗精灵  独霸宇宙  
the Dark Elves, reigned absolute

412
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:05,950
无人匹敌
and unchallenged.

413
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,610
诞自永恒之夜
"Born of eternal night,

414
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:11,320
黑暗精灵将盗走你的光明
the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light."

415
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:15,130
小时候母后跟我们讲过他们的故事
They were these stories mother told them to us as children.

416
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,240
他们的首领  马勒基斯
Their leader, Malekith

417
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:19,140
用那黑暗创造了一个武器
made a weapon out of that darkness,

418
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,750
叫做以太粒子
and it was called the Aether.

419
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:23,780
其他古物大都是固体
While the other relics often appeared as stones,

420
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,680
以太粒子却是不停变化的流体
the Aether is fluid and everchanging.

421
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:29,130
它能将物体变成暗物质
It changes matter into dark matter,

422
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:31,370
它寻找寄主寄生
it seeks out to host bodies,

423
00:32:31,370 --> 00:32:33,890
并汲取寄主的生命力
drawing strength from their life force.

424
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:37,340
马勒基斯想利用以太的能量
Malekith sought to use the Aether's power

425
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:41,090
让宇宙重归黑暗
to return the universe to one of darkness.

426
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:44,650
但历经了漫长的血战
But after eternities of blood shed,

427
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,530
我父王包尔  终于取胜
my father Bor, finally triumphed,

428
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:52,230
从此开启了数千年的和平
ushering in the peace that lasted thousands of years.

429
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,170
怎么个取胜法
What happened?

430
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:56,910
他消灭了黑暗精灵
He killed them all.

431
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,800
您确定吗
Are you certain?

432
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:01,640
传说以太粒子跟他们一同被摧毁
The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them

433
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,040
但如今却又出现
and yet here it is.

434
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,340
黑暗精灵已经灭绝
The Dark Elves are dead.

435
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:10,160
书上提到怎么把它从我身体里取出来吗
Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?

436
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:14,450
没有
No, it does not.

437
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,070
天体汇聚即将形成
The worlds are nealy aligned.

438
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,210
你将是最后一个诅咒战士
You will be the last of the Kursed.

439
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:37,210
我愿牺牲自己
Let my life be sacrificed.

440
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,950
就像我们的人民
It is no less than our people did,

441
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,130
和你那样
or you have done.

442
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,530
你将成为黑暗
You will become darkness,

443
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:57,470
并维持这一形态  直到它耗尽你的生命
cursed to this existence until it consumes you.

444
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,410
在那之前  我们的敌人将不是你的对手
Until then, no power our enemies possess can stop you.

445
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,110
我将摧毁他们的防线
I will tear down their defenses

446
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:16,350
让你回到一个崭新的宇宙中
and ensure your return to a universe reborn.

447
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:41,340
看管这些无赖真是有失我们的身份
Acting as caretakers to these scoundrels is beneath us.

448
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:42,760
拜托
Oh, please.

449
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,820
如果他们压在了你的身下  我壮硕的朋友
If they were beneath you my rotund friend,

450
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,020
他们肯定要没命了
they'd all be dead.

451
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:01,760
不要出列
Keep in line.

452
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,130
往前走
Move it!

453
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,940
奥丁总给我送新朋友来
Odin continues to bring me new friends.

454
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,920
真周到啊
How thoughtful.

455
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,650
我送来的书  你不喜欢吗
The books I sent, do they not interest you?

456
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:17,520
我就这么打发余生吗  读书
Is that how I'm to wile away eternity, reading?

457
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,760
我已经尽力让你过得舒坦些  洛基
I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.

458
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,880
是嘛
Have you?

459
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,850
奥丁也会操这份心吗
Does Odin share your concern?

460
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:27,440
托尔呢
Does Thor?

461
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:31,420
他们如此日夜挂念我  一定很操劳啊
It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night.

462
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:34,960
你很清楚  你落得这个下场完全是咎由自取
You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.

463
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,300
咎由自取
My actions.

464
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:38,250
你们一直骗我说我生来就该为王
I was merely giving truth to the lie

465
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:40,140
我不过是将这个谎言
that I've been fed my entire life,

466
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,830
变成了现实
that I was born to be a king.

467
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:42,870
为王
A king?

468
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,890
真正的国王会承认错误
A true king admits his faults.

469
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,430
你在地球大开杀戒要怎么说
What of the lives you took on Earth?

470
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:50,700
跟奥丁杀过的人相比简直九牛一毛
A mere handful compared to the number Odin has taken himself.

471
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:51,910
你父亲
Your father...

472
00:35:51,910 --> 00:35:53,670
他不是我父亲
He's not my father!

473
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,570
那我也不是你母亲吗
Then am I not your mother?

474
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,170
不是
You're not.

475
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:14,720
你总能看透一切  却看不透自己
You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself.

476
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:32,460
你去找我的时候就知道我有麻烦了吗
When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.

477
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:36,320
海姆达尔看不到你时  你就不在地球上了
When Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth.

478
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,930
这怎么可能啊
Well, how's that possible?

479
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:39,800
我认为你既在又不在
I believe you were and you weren't.

480
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:42,510
九大王国在世界树中游走
The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil,

481
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:46,100
像地球环绕太阳那样环绕米德加德
orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun.

482
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,650
每五千年  这些王国列成一条直线
And every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly,

483
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:52,470
我们称之为天体汇聚
and we call this the Convergence.

484
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:58,270
在此期间  各王国间的界线会变得模糊
During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred.

485
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,900
你可能就是找到了这样一个模糊点
It's possible you found one of these points.

486
00:37:04,340 --> 00:37:06,140
那个点没有关闭真是走运
We are lucky that it remained open.

487
00:37:06,770 --> 00:37:10,050
一旦各王国偏离汇聚直线
Once the worlds pass out of alignment,

488
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,230
与彼此的连接就会中断
the connection is lost.

489
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:29,750
我喜欢你解释的方式
I liked the way you explained things.

490
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,280
我会怎么样
What's gonna happen to me?

491
00:37:33,470 --> 00:37:34,980
我会想办法救你的  简
I'll find a way to save you, Jane.

492
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,030
你父亲说没办法...
Your father said there was...

493
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:38,440
我父亲也并非无所不知
My father doesn't know everything.

494
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,690
可别让他听见你说这话
Don't let him hear you say that.

495
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:44,170
简·福斯特  这位是弗丽嘉
Jane Foster, please meet Frigga,

496
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,610
阿斯加德的王后  我母亲
Queen of Asgard, my mother.

497
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,780
快走
Move!

498
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,580
快去地牢
To the dungeons!

499
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:30,910
快走
Come on!

500
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,620
走左边的楼梯吧
You might want to take the stairs to the left.

501
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,570
是监狱
The prisons.

502
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,860
洛基
Loki.

503
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:12,240
去吧  我会照顾她
Go, I will look after her.

504
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:26,320
他们简直像是讨厌被囚禁
It is as if they resented being imprisoned.

505
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,030
有些家伙就是不知足
There's no pleasing some creatures.

506
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,860
回牢房去  事后概不追究
Return to your cells, no further harm will come to you.

507
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:44,200
我保证
You have my word.

508
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,420
好吧  我收回
Very well, you do not have my word.

509
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:00,200
派一队人去武器库
Send a squadron to the weapons vault,

510
00:41:00,350 --> 00:41:03,280
不惜一切代价保卫那里  守住地牢
defend it at all costs. Secure the dungeon.

511
00:41:03,290 --> 00:41:04,270
奥丁
Odin.

512
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,390
弗丽嘉
Frigga.

513
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:06,560
去啊
Go!

514
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,810
就是点小乱子  不用担心
It's a skirmish, nothing to fear.

515
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,810
你一向不会撒谎
You've never been a very good liar.

516
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:15,000
带她去你房里  等安全了我会去找你
Take her to you chambers, I'll come for you when it's safe.

517
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,690
你小心
You take care.

518
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,950
历经了多少风风雨雨
Despite all I have survived,

519
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:21,660
我的王后还是会担心我
my queen still worries over me.

520
00:41:22,110 --> 00:41:25,150
就是因为我担心  你才能逢凶化吉
It's only because I worry over you that you have survived.

521
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,790
听好了
Listen to me now,

522
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:32,080
你要完全照我说的做  不许多问
I need you to do everything I ask and no questions.

523
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,380
是  夫人
Yes, ma'am.

524
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:46,110
阿斯加德的王座被毁了  去保护国王
The throne of Asgard is destroyed! To the king!

525
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:02,800
弗丽嘉
Frigga.

526
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:13,460
退下  怪物
Stand down, creature.

527
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:15,860
我尚可饶你一命
And you may still survive this.

528
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:18,070
我命大得很呢  女人
I have survive worse, woman.

529
00:47:19,330 --> 00:47:20,570
你是谁
Who are you?

530
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,910
我是马勒基斯
I am Malekith.

531
00:47:23,470 --> 00:47:25,540
我要拿回我的东西
And I would have what is mine.

532
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,220
你拿走了一样东西  孩子
You have taken something, child.

533
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,760
还给我
Give it back.

534
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:16,800
女巫
Witch.

535
00:48:20,250 --> 00:48:21,460
以太粒子在哪
Where is the Aether.

536
00:48:22,010 --> 00:48:23,860
我绝不会告诉你
I'll never tell you.

537
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,430
这我相信
I believe you.

538
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:31,170
不
No.

539
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,530
宇宙五千年一个循环
The universe rotates on a five thousand years cycle.

540
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:03,620
每轮循环中会有一次  各个世界排列成直线
And once a cycle, all the worlds align.

541
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:03,220
{\an5}{\pos(256.8,157.333)}地球
(米德加德)

542
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:03,220
{\an5}{\pos(88,200)}尼德威阿尔

543
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:03,220
{\an5}{\pos(315.6,65.6)}华纳海姆

544
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:03,220
{\an5}{\pos(353.6,230.934)}约顿海姆

545
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:06,480
把这个想象成我们的世界
Imagine... imagine that this is our world,

546
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:08,220
谢谢
oh, thank you,

547
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,630
这是另一个世界
and this is another world,

548
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:11,350
一般来说  他们彼此分开
normally, they're seperate.

549
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,570
但世界汇聚时
But during the Alignment,

550
00:52:13,570 --> 00:52:15,150
一切都彼此相连
everything is connected,

551
00:52:15,830 --> 00:52:19,660
九大王国都在穿过彼此
all nine realms. All nine realms are passing through each other,

552
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:22,140
重力  光  甚至物质
and gravity, light, and even matter

553
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:24,480
都会从一个世界挤进另一个世界
is crushing from one world to the other.

554
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:30,420
如果这一切现在发生  后果将是毁灭性的
But if this happens to us now, the result could be cataclysmic.

555
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:33,330
我的重力测量仪能稳定
My gravimetric-spikes can stablize

556
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:36,030
天体汇聚的界点
the focus point of the Convergance.

557
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:38,570
这样  其他世界
This time, the Alignment

558
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,530
和他们的纵列就会跟我们擦肩而过
and all the other worlds would just pass us by.

559
00:52:41,710 --> 00:52:43,030
太妙了
It's beautiful.

560
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:45,970
也很简单
Simple.

561
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:47,310
有什么问题吗
Any questions?

562
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:53,750
有  能把我的鞋还给我吗
Yeah, can I have my shoe back?

563
00:53:01,900 --> 00:53:05,250
恢复吧  夺回以太粒子  你需要力气
Heal. You will need your strength to reclaim the Aether.

564
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,200
等你醒来  我们去把他们赶尽杀绝
And when you wake, we will kill them all.

565
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:47,590
简·福斯特
Jane Foster?

566
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:50,200
你得跟我们来
You need to come with us.

567
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,330
我们依然无法恢复王宫的屏障
We are still unable to restore the palace shields.

568
00:53:55,330 --> 00:53:57,060
我们的大炮探测不到他们
Our artillery cannot detect them,

569
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,030
海姆达尔都看不到他们
even Heimdall cannot see them.

570
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,330
陛下
My king,

571
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,840
我们完全失去了防御能力
we're all but defenseless.

572
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,120
你把她囚禁起来了
She's your prisoner now?

573
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:13,530
都退下
Leave us.

574
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,570
我不想跟你争论
I do not wish to fight with you.

575
00:54:25,410 --> 00:54:27,330
我也不想跟您争论
Nor I with you.

576
00:54:27,330 --> 00:54:29,240
但我想去追击马勒基斯
But I intended to pursue Malekith.

577
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,020
以太粒子在我们手上
We possess the Aether.

578
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:32,740
马勒基斯会送上门来
Malekith will come to us.

579
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:34,690
没错  他会摧毁我们
Yes, and he will destroy us.

580
00:54:34,690 --> 00:54:37,110
你高估了这些怪物
You overestimate the power of these creatures.

581
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:39,430
不  我只是珍惜我们人民的生命
No, I value our people's lives.

582
00:54:39,430 --> 00:54:41,040
我带简去黑暗世界
I'll take Jane to the Dark World,

583
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,370
将敌人从阿斯加德引开
and draw the enemies away from Asgard.

584
00:54:43,550 --> 00:54:45,610
马勒基斯把以太粒子从简身体里取出时
When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane,

585
00:54:45,610 --> 00:54:47,940
它会暴露在外  不堪一击
it would be exposed and vulnerable.

586
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,100
我到时就把他们一同消灭
And I would destroy it and him.

587
00:54:51,630 --> 00:54:52,990
你这是冒险
If you fail,

588
00:54:53,710 --> 00:54:56,640
一旦失败  武器就会落入敌手
you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemie.

589
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,320
如果我们坐以待毙只会更危险
The risk is far greater if we do nothing.

590
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,270
他的舰队可能此刻就在我们头上盘旋
His ships could be over our heads right now,

591
00:55:01,270 --> 00:55:02,500
我们根本无从知道
we would never even know.

592
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,040
等他来了
If and when he comes,

593
00:55:04,190 --> 00:55:07,780
他的手下会败在数万阿斯加德士兵的兵刃下
his men will fall on ten thousand Asgardian blades.

594
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,590
那我们又要牺牲多少人呢
And how many our men should fall on theirs?

595
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:11,640
牺牲多少都在所不惜
As many as I need it.

596
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:21,910
我们会坚持战斗
We will fight

597
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,700
坚持到最后一个阿斯加德人
till the last Asgardian breath,

598
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,210
坚持到阿斯加德人鲜血流尽
till the last drop of Asgardian blood.

599
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:36,470
那您跟马勒基斯又有何区别
Then how are you different from Malekith?

600
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:41,840
我的儿子  区别在于  我终将胜利
The different, my son, is that I will win.

601
00:55:56,310 --> 00:55:57,790
简不回我电话
Jane isn't calling me back.

602
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,410
艾瑞克不回我电话
Erik isn't calling me Back.

603
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,190
神盾局也不回我电话
Stupid S.H.I.E.L.D isn't calling me back.

604
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:02,230
神盾局是什么
What's S.H.I.E.L.D?

605
00:56:02,230 --> 00:56:03,050
是秘密
It's a secret.

606
00:56:03,230 --> 00:56:05,450
艾瑞克  又是达西
Hi, Erik, it's Darcy again.

607
00:56:05,710 --> 00:56:06,820
托尔回来了
Thor came back,

608
00:56:06,860 --> 00:56:08,250
他把简带去了阿斯加德
he took Jane to Asgard.

609
00:56:08,250 --> 00:56:12,180
我也不知道该怎么办才好
And I'm not sure what I'm suppose to do.

610
00:56:12,230 --> 00:56:13,980
这周还有人丢了点什么
Something else went missing this week,

611
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:17,020
天体物理学家  艾瑞克·塞尔维格博士
when astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig

612
00:56:17,070 --> 00:56:19,710
因卷入纽约外星人入侵事件
notable for his involvement in the alien invasion

613
00:56:19,710 --> 00:56:20,700
而为人所知
of New York.

614
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:24,500
-裸奔在...  -达西  你得看看这个
- Stripped nude... - Darcy, you really need to look at this.

615
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,360
你的朋友艾瑞克
Your friend Erik,

616
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:27,950
他姓什么来着
what was his last name again?

617
00:56:29,170 --> 00:56:32,590
并对该历史景点的游客大吼大叫
...and began shouting at visitors to the historic site.

618
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:35,170
随后他被警方拘留
He was later taken into police custody

619
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:37,280
以待精神鉴定
for psychiatric evaluation.

620
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:39,980
警方仍然不肯证实...
The police is still refusing to confirm...

621
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,090
你没去参加奥丁的军事会议
You were not at Odin's war council.

622
00:56:52,610 --> 00:56:55,290
你父王下令关闭彩虹桥
The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders.

623
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:57,320
任何人不得进出阿斯加德
No one was to come, or to go.

624
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:02,330
连我都看不见敌人
We face an enemy that is invisible even to me,

625
00:57:02,330 --> 00:57:03,650
那么
what use

626
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:06,090
我这个守卫还有何用
is a guardian such as that.

627
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:09,880
马勒基斯还会回来的  这你很清楚
Malekith will return. You know this.

628
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:14,230
我需要你的帮助
I need your help.

629
00:57:14,830 --> 00:57:16,900
我不能违抗国王的命令
I cannot overrule my king's wishes.

630
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:18,640
即便是为你
Not even for you.

631
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,000
我没有这个意思
I'm not asking you to.

632
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,940
九大王国需要一个坚强  服众的众神之父
The realms need their All-father strong and unchallenged,

633
00:57:22,940 --> 00:57:24,490
不论情况是否如此
whether he is or not.

634
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,130
但他看不清现实  海姆达尔
But he's binded Heimdall,

635
00:57:27,770 --> 00:57:29,270
仇恨和悲伤蒙蔽了他
by hatred and by grief.

636
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:30,200
我们不都是吗
As are we all.

637
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:31,980
我看得很清楚
I see clearly enough.

638
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:34,090
风险太大了
The risks are to great.

639
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:36,570
从现在起  我们走的每一步都有风险
Everything we do from here on is a risk.

640
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,280
我们别无选择
There is no other way.

641
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:44,250
你要我怎么做
What do you require of me.

642
00:57:45,060 --> 00:57:48,180
我要你们做的事  是最严重的叛国罪
What I'm about to ask you is treason of the highest order.

643
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:50,710
即便成功  我们也将被流放
Success will bring us exile,

644
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,660
而失败则必死无疑
and failure shall mean our death.

645
00:57:55,710 --> 00:57:58,270
马勒基斯知道以太粒子在这儿
Malekith knew the Aether was here.

646
00:57:58,360 --> 00:57:59,880
他能感应它的能量
He can sense its power.

647
00:58:00,250 --> 00:58:02,710
如果不采取行动  他会再次攻来
If we do nothing, he'll come for it again,

648
00:58:02,710 --> 00:58:06,000
但这次  他们将彻底摧毁阿斯加德
but this time, lay waste to all of Asgard.

649
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,820
我们得带简离开这儿
We must move Jane off world.

650
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,430
彩虹桥已经关闭
The Bifrost has been shut down,

651
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:13,540
宇宙魔方也锁在地下室里
and the Tesseract locked away in the vault.

652
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:15,950
离开阿斯加德还有其他途径
There are other path off Asgard,

653
00:58:16,310 --> 00:58:17,950
了解这些途径的人为数不多
ways known only to a few.

654
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,660
准确说只有一个
One actually.

655
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:22,840
不会吧
No.

656
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,440
托尔
Thor.

657
00:58:30,050 --> 00:58:31,230
都这么久了
After all this time,

658
00:58:31,230 --> 00:58:33,240
你现在来看我
and now you come to visit me,

659
00:58:35,310 --> 00:58:36,310
来干什么
why?

660
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:39,590
幸灾乐祸吗
Have you come to gloat?

661
00:58:40,510 --> 00:58:41,130
嘲笑我
To mock?

662
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:42,360
洛基  够了
Loki enough.

663
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,680
别再用幻象了
No more illusions.

664
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,630
现在你看到我了  哥哥
Now you see me brother.

665
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:04,100
她走得痛苦吗
Did she suffer?

666
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,730
我不是来跟你一同哀悼母亲的
I did not come here to share our grief.

667
00:59:07,330 --> 00:59:10,410
我是来给你机会得到一样更好的东西
Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.

668
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,670
说
Go on.

669
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:15,490
我知道你跟我一样想复仇
I know you seek vengeance as much as I do.

670
00:59:16,120 --> 00:59:18,770
你帮我逃出阿斯加德  我就给你机会
You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you.

671
00:59:19,240 --> 00:59:20,190
让你复仇
Vengeance.

672
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:22,210
然后再回这儿来
And afterwards this cell.

673
00:59:29,920 --> 00:59:34,110
你一定是走投无路了  才会来找我帮忙
You must be truely desperate to come to me for help.

674
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,960
你凭什么觉得你能信任我
What makes you think you can trust me.

675
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,030
我不信任
I don't.

676
00:59:41,180 --> 00:59:42,140
母亲信任你
Mother did.

677
00:59:43,450 --> 00:59:46,070
但你要知道  过去我们交手的时候
But you should know that when we fought each other in the past,

678
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:48,330
我仍然抱有一丝希望
I did so with a glimpse of hope

679
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,470
相信我弟弟还没完全消失
that my brother was still in there somewhere.

680
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:54,190
这一丝希望已经幻灭  不能再保护你了
That hope is no longer exist to protect you.

681
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,210
你敢背叛我  我就杀了你
You betray me, and I will kill you.

682
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:05,360
什么时候出发
When do we start?

683
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,350
他肯定会背叛你的
He will betray you.

684
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:08,580
让他试试看
He will try.

685
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:15,300
这太不像你了  哥哥
This is so unlike you, brother.

686
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,660
这样秘密行动
So clandestine.

687
01:00:18,410 --> 01:00:21,040
你真的不想靠蛮力打出一条血路出去吗
Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out.

688
01:00:21,260 --> 01:00:23,150
你再不闭嘴我就要动手了
If you keep speaking I just might.

689
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:24,910
好吧  听你的
Fine, as you wish,

690
01:00:25,370 --> 01:00:26,720
我都不在这儿
I'm not even here.

691
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:28,890
这样好点了吧
Is this better?

692
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:31,110
比你本人强多了
It's better company at least.

693
01:00:32,230 --> 01:00:35,490
不过  我们还可以再低调点
Still, we could be less conspicuous.

694
01:00:37,420 --> 01:00:38,520
哥哥
Umm, brother,

695
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,130
你可真美
you look ravishing.

696
01:00:42,030 --> 01:00:44,490
就算变成这样  我照样能让你死得很惨
It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.

697
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,710
好吧
Very well.

698
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,120
或许你想要你新结交的小伙伴
Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions,

699
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:50,400
毕竟你似乎很喜欢他们
given that you seem to like them so much.

700
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:52,250
这样好多了呢
Oh this is much better.

701
01:00:54,170 --> 01:00:55,610
服装不太合身
The costume is bit much.

702
01:00:55,630 --> 01:00:56,850
太紧了
So tight.

703
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,230
但那股自信
But the confidence,

704
01:00:58,230 --> 01:01:00,700
我能感到正义在我身体里涌动
I can feel the righteousness surging.

705
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,490
想跟我畅谈一下真理吗
Hey, do you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth?

706
01:01:03,570 --> 01:01:04,350
或是荣誉
Honor?

707
01:01:04,390 --> 01:01:05,430
爱国主义
Patriotism?

708
01:01:05,430 --> 01:01:06,710
天佑美国...
God bless America...

709
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:09,710
干什么
What?

710
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:16,730
你至少也该给我件武器啊
You could at least furnish me with a weapon.

711
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,770
我的匕首什么的
My dagger, something.

712
01:01:24,760 --> 01:01:25,710
这才对嘛
At last,

713
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:27,830
总算讲点理了
a little common sense.

714
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,500
你不就喜欢小戏法吗
And I thought you like tricks.

715
01:01:36,540 --> 01:01:37,550
然后呢
Well, what then?

716
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:40,990
你心爱的凡人被一整队英灵战士看守着
Your lovely mortal is been guarded by a legion of Einherjar

717
01:01:40,990 --> 01:01:42,840
他们大老远就能看到你
who will see you coming from miles away.

718
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,900
去接她的不是我
I won't be the one who comes for her.

719
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:53,720
我不饿
I'm not hungry.

720
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,440
那正好  我们走
Good, let's go.

721
01:02:04,090 --> 01:02:04,840
是你...
You're...

722
01:02:04,970 --> 01:02:06,640
我是洛基  你可能听说过我
I'm Loki, you may have heard of me.

723
01:02:07,330 --> 01:02:08,680
这一掌是为了纽约
That was for New York.

724
01:02:09,740 --> 01:02:10,770
我喜欢她
I like her.

725
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:12,890
那众神之父呢
And what of the All-Father?

726
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:17,150
我曾立誓向他通报一切叛国罪行
It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne.

727
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:19,010
你要我过来
You called me here

728
01:02:19,420 --> 01:02:20,770
说是有紧急情况
on urgent matter.

729
01:02:22,150 --> 01:02:22,920
是什么事
What is it?

730
01:02:23,520 --> 01:02:24,820
有人叛国犯上  陛下
Treason, my lord.

731
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:25,790
是谁
Whose?

732
01:02:27,060 --> 01:02:27,880
我
Mine.

733
01:02:29,210 --> 01:02:30,030
陛下
My king,

734
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:32,020
那个凡人被劫走了
the mortal has been taken.

735
01:02:36,300 --> 01:02:37,430
阻止托尔
Stop Thor,

736
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,310
不惜一切代价
by any means necessary.

737
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:43,720
他们在那儿  抓住他们
There they are! Take them.

738
01:02:44,590 --> 01:02:45,690
听我命令
On my command.

739
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:47,440
我拖住他们  带她走
I'll hold them off. Take her.

740
01:02:48,710 --> 01:02:49,490
谢谢你
Thank you.

741
01:02:52,760 --> 01:02:53,760
你敢背叛他
Betray him,

742
01:02:53,850 --> 01:02:54,870
我就杀了你
and I'll kill you.

743
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,670
我也很高兴见到你  希芙
It's good to see you, too, Sif.

744
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:09,280
就算洛基肯帮你  你也救出了那个凡人
Assuming you can get Loki's help and you can free this mortal,

745
01:03:09,980 --> 01:03:11,250
又有什么用啊
what good would it do?

746
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:14,390
我们踏出宫殿一步  就必死无疑
We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.

747
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:17,760
所以  我的朋友  我们不会步行离开
That, my friend, is why we won't be leaving by foot.

748
01:03:21,800 --> 01:03:23,720
我尽量帮你拖延时间
I will give you as much time as I can.

749
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,990
谢谢你  我的朋友
Thank you, my friend.

750
01:03:29,630 --> 01:03:32,250
你胆敢打背叛他的主意
If you even think of betraying him.

751
01:03:32,310 --> 01:03:33,530
你就杀了我吗
You'll kill me?

752
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:36,120
看来你得排队了
Evidently there will be a line.

753
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,750
你不是说你会驾驶这东西吗
I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.

754
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:55,940
我是说这能有多难
I said "How hard could it be".

755
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:00,640
他们在飞船上
They're on the ship.

756
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:02,410
拦住飞船
Get to the ship.

757
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:08,620
不管你在做什么  哥哥  你得快点了
Well, whatever you're doing brother, I suggest you do it faster.

758
01:04:08,630 --> 01:04:09,730
闭嘴  洛基
Shut up, Loki.

759
01:04:12,510 --> 01:04:13,780
你肯定漏掉什么了
You must have missed something.

760
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:16,250
我没有  我把这上面的按钮都按遍了
No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing.

761
01:04:16,250 --> 01:04:17,970
别用力那么猛  轻轻按
No. Don't hit it, just press it gently.

762
01:04:17,970 --> 01:04:20,890
我在轻轻按了  不好使
I am pressing it gently, it's not working.

763
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,370
擒住他  拿下他
Get him! Get him!

764
01:04:58,750 --> 01:04:59,810
还有根柱子没撞到呢
I think you missed a column.

765
01:04:59,820 --> 01:05:00,610
闭嘴
Shut up!

766
01:05:07,590 --> 01:05:08,890
你为什么不让我来呢
Look, why don't you let me take over,

767
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:10,380
我的驾驶技术显然更好
I'm clearly the best pilot.

768
01:05:10,500 --> 01:05:11,400
是嘛
Is that right?

769
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:14,290
我们两个人中  谁才是会飞的那个
Well, out of the two of us, which one can actually fly?

770
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,460
天啊  她死了吗
Oh dear, is she dead?

771
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:27,250
简
Jane.

772
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,170
我没事
I'm okay.

773
01:05:36,170 --> 01:05:37,450
别多嘴
Not a word.

774
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,870
他们跟上来了
Now they're following us.

775
01:05:46,270 --> 01:05:47,210
他们开火了
Now they're firing at us.

776
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:48,920
多谢你的解说  洛基
Yeah, thank you for the commentary Loki,

777
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:50,500
完全不会让人分心
it's not at all distracting.

778
01:05:54,950 --> 01:05:57,560
干得漂亮  你把你爷爷的头砍下来了
Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather.

779
01:06:08,860 --> 01:06:10,160
这真是太棒了
You know this is wonderful,

780
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:12,580
这主意真是了不起
this is a tremendous idea.

781
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:16,190
我们去把宇宙中最大最显眼的飞船偷来
Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe,

782
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:17,450
乘着它逃跑
and escape in that.

783
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:18,490
驾着它满城乱飞
Flying around the city,

784
01:06:18,490 --> 01:06:21,060
看见什么撞什么  让大家都看见我们
smashing into everything in sight, so everyone can see us.

785
01:06:21,070 --> 01:06:22,260
太聪明了  托尔
It's brilliant, Thor.

786
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:23,460
真有你的
It's truly brilliant.

787
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:38,940
在牢里关了那么久
I see your time in the dungeons

788
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:41,570
你还是这么优雅啊  洛基
has make you no less graceful, Loki.

789
01:06:46,010 --> 01:06:47,110
你骗我
You lied to me.

790
01:06:49,150 --> 01:06:50,330
挺厉害啊
I'm impressed.

791
01:06:50,360 --> 01:06:51,630
你满意我很高兴
I'm glad you're pleased.

792
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,010
遵守你的承诺吧
Now do as you promised.

793
01:06:53,150 --> 01:06:55,010
带我们去你的秘密通道
And take us to your secret pathway.

794
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:19,020
范达尔
Fandral.

795
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:19,950
好的
Right.

796
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,610
为了阿斯加德
For Asgard.

797
01:07:29,940 --> 01:07:31,320
别往心里去啊  伙计们
Nothing personal, boys.

798
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:47,820
洛基
Loki.

799
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:49,370
如果那么容易
If it were easy,

800
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:51,400
谁都能做到了
everyone would do it.

801
01:07:51,720 --> 01:07:52,680
你疯了吗
Are you mad?

802
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:53,660
或许吧
Possibly.

803
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:10,360
胜利到达
Ta-da.

804
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:19,140
我们得马上出击
We must strike now.

805
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:21,630
不
No.

806
01:08:22,490 --> 01:08:28,790
不必去阿斯加德了
Asgard is meaningless.

807
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:34,750
以太自己送上门了
The Aether has found its way home.

808
01:08:50,590 --> 01:08:54,050
那能量要是给我  我能做多少事啊
What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.

809
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,890
你会被吞噬的
It would consume you.

810
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,580
她不就没事
She's holding up all right

811
01:09:00,410 --> 01:09:01,490
暂时没事
For now.

812
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:04,280
她拥有的力量你无法理解
She's strong in ways you'd never even know.

813
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,970
道别吧
Say goodbye.

814
01:09:06,770 --> 01:09:07,730
不会是今天
Not this day.

815
01:09:07,790 --> 01:09:09,240
今天  明天
This day, the next,

816
01:09:09,350 --> 01:09:10,890
一百年  算什么
a hundred years, is nothing,

817
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,370
弹指一挥间而已
it's a heartbeat.

818
01:09:14,050 --> 01:09:15,520
你永远放不开手
You'll never be ready.

819
01:09:16,450 --> 01:09:19,480
你唯一珍视的挚爱终将被岁月夺去
The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.

820
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:21,360
那样你就满足了吗
And will that satisfy you.

821
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:22,680
我永远不会满足
Satisfaction is not in my nature.

822
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:24,120
我永远不会放弃
Surrender is not in mine.

823
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,090
果然是奥丁之子
Son of Odin.

824
01:09:27,090 --> 01:09:29,180
我不只是奥丁的儿子
No, not just of Odin.

825
01:09:29,610 --> 01:09:31,940
你以为母亲只爱你吗
You think you alone were loved of Mother?

826
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:34,530
她把诡计教给了你  但把信任交给了我
You had her tricks but I had her trust.

827
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:35,390
信任
Trust?

828
01:09:36,530 --> 01:09:38,160
那是她的遗言吗
Was that her last expression?

829
01:09:38,670 --> 01:09:39,630
她信任你
Trust?

830
01:09:39,670 --> 01:09:41,140
你却眼睁睁看她遇害
When you let her die?

831
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:42,980
你在地牢里出手相救了吗
What help were you in your cell?

832
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:43,940
谁把我关进去的
Who put me there?

833
01:09:44,110 --> 01:09:45,550
谁把我关进去的
Who put me there?

834
01:09:45,550 --> 01:09:48,720
你心里清楚  你心里清楚是谁
You know damn well. You know damn well who.

835
01:09:55,130 --> 01:09:57,080
她不会希望我们兄弟相争
She wouldn't want us to fight.

836
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:01,370
她都见怪不怪了吧
Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.

837
01:10:06,060 --> 01:10:08,050
真希望我能相信你
I wish I can trust you.

838
01:10:23,110 --> 01:10:24,600
相信我的怒火吧
Trust my rage.

839
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:34,740
塞尔维格先生  请签收您父亲的物品
You'll have to sign for your fathers' belongings Mr. Selvig.

840
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:36,040
什么
What?

841
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:37,890
啊对
Oh, yeah.

842
01:10:38,540 --> 01:10:41,180
我父亲  艾瑞克·塞尔维格博士
My father Dr. Erik Selvig.

843
01:10:42,870 --> 01:10:45,320
一个棕色男士钱包
One man's leather wallet, brown,

844
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,520
一串钥匙  共三把
one keyring, three keys,

845
01:10:48,040 --> 01:10:49,380
处方药
prescription medicine,

846
01:10:50,510 --> 01:10:51,600
若干
various.

847
01:10:54,270 --> 01:10:56,120
-还有  -艾瑞克
- And, - Erik.

848
01:10:57,860 --> 01:11:00,310
-这些  -对  这些
- These. - Yeah, those.

849
01:11:00,880 --> 01:11:01,990
谢天谢地
Thank goodness.

850
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:04,880
艾瑞克
Erik.

851
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:07,730
嗯
Yes.

852
01:11:08,090 --> 01:11:09,940
我是达西
It's...Darcy.

853
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,220
达西
Darcy.

854
01:11:13,290 --> 01:11:14,730
见到你真高兴
So good to see you.

855
01:11:14,900 --> 01:11:16,320
我也挺想你
I miss you too.

856
01:11:16,330 --> 01:11:17,440
你怎么找到我的
How did you find me?

857
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:19,010
你在电视上裸奔了
You were naked on TV.

858
01:11:19,970 --> 01:11:22,210
好了  该走了  还有事要做
Okay, it's time to go, lots to do.

859
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:25,830
越来越尴尬了
Getting weird now.

860
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:30,860
怎么能让我管这些事
I should not be left in charge of stuff like this,

861
01:11:30,860 --> 01:11:32,030
又没人给我那么多钱
I don't get paid enough.

862
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:33,460
是根本没人给我钱
I don't get paid period.

863
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:37,250
那个  我叫伊恩  达西的实习生
I'm Ian, by the way, Darcy's inter.

864
01:11:37,390 --> 01:11:38,980
也没人给我钱
Yeah, I don't get paid either.

865
01:11:40,100 --> 01:11:41,600
你没事吧
Are you alright?

866
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:43,790
我脑子里进去过个神
I've had a god in my brain.

867
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,660
这滋味可不好受了
I don't recommend it.

868
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,770
塞尔维格博士  这设备响了
Dr. Selvig, sir, your gear is beeping.

869
01:11:50,770 --> 01:11:51,660
果然开始了
It's happening.

870
01:11:51,660 --> 01:11:53,280
比我计算得还早
It's sooner than I calculate.

871
01:11:53,300 --> 01:11:54,650
什么开始了
Wait what's happening?

872
01:11:58,430 --> 01:11:59,130
鸟吗
Birds?

873
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:01,140
鸟儿开始了
Birds are happening?

874
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,840
那是一群欧椋鸟
It's starling. It's called the murmuration.

875
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:03,840
{\an3}{\pos(374,247)}murmuration是专门用于一大群欧椋鸟的量词

876
01:12:03,850 --> 01:12:06,150
小时候我爸常带我去观鸟
My dad, he used to take me bird watching as a kid.

877
01:12:06,320 --> 01:12:07,090
呆子
Nerd.

878
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:07,900
看
Look.

879
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:13,500
他们去哪了
Where did they go?

880
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:28,770
刚刚怎么回事
What the hell was that?

881
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:31,390
你笑什么
Why are you smiling?

882
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:33,860
发现这世界比我还疯狂
There's nothing more reassuring than realize

883
01:12:33,860 --> 01:12:35,940
我倍感安心
that the world is crazier than you are.

884
01:12:37,300 --> 01:12:38,750
带我去简的实验室
Take me to Jane's lab.

885
01:12:52,310 --> 01:12:53,060
简
Jane.

886
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:01,500
马勒基斯
Malekith.

887
01:13:24,130 --> 01:13:25,260
准备好了吗
All right, are you ready?

888
01:13:26,190 --> 01:13:27,040
我准备好了
I am.

889
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:43,230
你这破计划得把咱俩都害死
You know this plan of yours is gonna get us killed.

890
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:44,290
或许吧
Yeah, possibly.

891
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:50,410
你还不相信我吗  哥哥
You still don't trust me, brother?

892
01:13:51,590 --> 01:13:52,370
你会相信你吗
Would you?

893
01:14:02,030 --> 01:14:03,570
不会
No, I wouldn't.

894
01:14:07,590 --> 01:14:08,550
托尔
Thor.

895
01:14:10,160 --> 01:14:10,940
不
No.

896
01:14:20,970 --> 01:14:23,530
你真以为我在乎弗丽嘉
You really think I cared about Frigga.

897
01:14:23,710 --> 01:14:25,190
在乎你们任何人吗
About any of you.

898
01:14:28,390 --> 01:14:29,960
我只渴望
All I ever wanted

899
01:14:30,510 --> 01:14:31,840
看到你和奥丁
was you and Odin

900
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,360
死在我脚下
dead at my feet.

901
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:47,100
马勒基斯
Malekith.

902
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:50,370
我是约顿海姆的洛基
I am Loki of Jotunheim.

903
01:14:50,860 --> 01:14:52,500
我给你送来了大礼
And I bring you a gift.

904
01:14:54,060 --> 01:14:55,960
我要的回报很简单
I ask only one thing in return.

905
01:14:56,720 --> 01:14:59,840
让我看着阿斯加德化为灰烬
A good seat from which to watch Asgard burned.

906
01:15:00,460 --> 01:15:03,120
他是阿斯加德的敌人
He is an enemy of Asgard.

907
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:05,770
他也被关在他们的地牢里
He was a prisoner in their dungeons.

908
01:15:20,110 --> 01:15:21,170
看着我
Look at me.

909
01:16:19,270 --> 01:16:21,030
洛基  快
Loki, now!

910
01:19:35,470 --> 01:19:36,940
不
No!

911
01:19:46,340 --> 01:19:48,270
我们地狱见  怪物
See you in hell, monster.

912
01:20:07,060 --> 01:20:08,990
不不不不
No, no, no, no...

913
01:20:11,130 --> 01:20:14,120
-你真傻  怎么不听我的  -我知道
- You fool, you didn't listen. - I know.

914
01:20:15,470 --> 01:20:16,620
我真傻
I'm a fool.

915
01:20:17,050 --> 01:20:19,090
-我真傻  -挺住
- I'm a fool. - Stay with me. Okay?

916
01:20:19,550 --> 01:20:20,600
对不起
I'm sorry.

917
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,060
对不起  对不起
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

918
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:25,220
没事的
It's okay.

919
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,450
没事的
It's all right.

920
01:20:30,940 --> 01:20:33,310
你的英勇我会禀告父王
I'll tell father what you did here today.

921
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:39,420
我不是为了他
I didn't do it for him.

922
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:51,000
不
No!

923
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:46,880
他要释放以太
He's going to unleash it.

924
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,550
不只是在阿斯加德或是哪个星球
No just on Asgard or on a stars.

925
01:21:49,550 --> 01:21:52,920
马勒基斯要毁灭一切
Malekith is gonna destroy everything.

926
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:53,970
怎么毁灭
How?

927
01:21:54,860 --> 01:21:56,120
简  怎么毁灭
Jane, how?

928
01:21:56,240 --> 01:21:59,580
我看到他在地球上  他去那儿干什么
I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?

929
01:22:00,090 --> 01:22:01,310
天体汇聚
The Convergence.

930
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:02,730
天哪
Oh, God.

931
01:22:02,730 --> 01:22:05,380
我要是没发现以太  就不会走到这一步了
None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.

932
01:22:06,150 --> 01:22:09,110
马勒基斯只会更早得到以太
Then Malekith would've only possess that much sooner.

933
01:22:09,610 --> 01:22:11,900
我是找你的时候发现了以太
I only found it because I was looking for you.

934
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:13,840
简
Jane.

935
01:22:15,610 --> 01:22:17,270
结果困在这儿了
Now we're trapped here.

936
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,290
不是我
It's not me.

937
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:27,060
喂
Hello?

938
01:22:27,060 --> 01:22:29,170
简  是我  理查德
Hi, Jane, it's Richard.

939
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:30,940
理查德  你在哪
Richard? Where are you?

940
01:22:30,940 --> 01:22:34,200
还在办公室里  今天忙疯了
I'm still at the office, it's...it's been a crazy day here today.

941
01:22:34,200 --> 01:22:35,510
天哪  太神奇了
Oh, my God, this is amazing.

942
01:22:35,510 --> 01:22:37,670
是吗  跟你共进午餐很开心
Is it? I quite enjoy our lunch.

943
01:22:37,670 --> 01:22:39,880
虽然什么都没点
Despite never actually ordering anything.

944
01:22:39,890 --> 01:22:41,590
这地方怎么有信号
How am I getting service here?

945
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,560
现在不方便吗  要不我过会儿再打
Is it a bad time? Do you want me to try later?

946
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,620
不不  无论如何
No, no, no... please, whatever you do,

947
01:22:45,620 --> 01:22:47,090
千万别挂电话
do not hang up the phone.

948
01:22:47,960 --> 01:22:48,960
好吧
Okay then.

949
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:51,180
我就是想问你想不想再约一次
I was just wondering if you want to try again.

950
01:22:51,180 --> 01:22:52,780
一起共进晚餐吧
Uh, maybe dinner next time.

951
01:22:52,790 --> 01:22:54,270
好啊
Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

952
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:55,890
别挂电话  好吗
Just... stay on the phone, okay?

953
01:22:55,890 --> 01:22:57,220
好呀
Yeah, I will.

954
01:22:57,220 --> 01:22:58,410
天哪
Oh, my God.

955
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:04,060
你在忙吗
Am I interrupting something?

956
01:23:04,060 --> 01:23:05,760
没  没有
No, no... nothing at all.

957
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,230
-走吧  -我听不清  你在隧道里吗
- Come on. - I'm losing you there, are you in tunnel?

958
01:23:08,240 --> 01:23:09,580
怎么  这是去哪
What? Where are we going?

959
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:10,930
喂
Hello?

960
01:23:10,930 --> 01:23:12,650
这里怎么这么多鞋
Why are there so many shoes in here?

961
01:23:14,350 --> 01:23:15,710
还是发短信吧
I'll just text her.

962
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:29,790
理查德是谁
So who's Richard?

963
01:23:29,790 --> 01:23:30,900
你不是吧
Really?

964
01:23:39,630 --> 01:23:40,640
简
Jane.

965
01:23:41,140 --> 01:23:44,540
你怎么说走就走  全世界都疯了
You can't just leave like that. The whole world is going crazy.

966
01:23:44,540 --> 01:23:46,570
我们之前看到的异象到处都是了
All the stuff we saw is spreading.

967
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:48,760
你去参加派对了吗
Did you go to a party?

968
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:49,930
艾瑞克
Erik?

969
01:23:50,220 --> 01:23:51,260
简
Jane.

970
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:52,860
太好了
How wonderful.

971
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:56,610
你去阿斯加德了
You've been to Asgard.

972
01:23:56,610 --> 01:23:57,440
你的裤子呢
Where are your pants?

973
01:23:57,450 --> 01:23:59,290
他说光着有助于思考
Oh, he says it helps him think.

974
01:23:59,290 --> 01:24:01,180
你的研究成果都给我
Okay, well, I'm gonna need everything you got on this,

975
01:24:01,180 --> 01:24:03,530
所有针对重力异常的研究
all the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies,

976
01:24:03,530 --> 01:24:04,730
-都给我  -好吧
- everything. - Okay.

977
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:06,550
你还好吧  艾瑞克
Are you well, Erik?

978
01:24:07,840 --> 01:24:09,700
你弟弟不来吧
Your brother's not coming, is he?

979
01:24:10,310 --> 01:24:11,730
洛基死了
Loki is dead.

980
01:24:11,730 --> 01:24:13,090
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God.

981
01:24:14,090 --> 01:24:16,550
那个  请节哀
I.. meant, I'm so sorry.

982
01:24:16,550 --> 01:24:17,600
谢谢
Thank you.

983
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,070
打扰了  陛下
Forgive me, my liege.

984
01:24:44,310 --> 01:24:46,630
我从黑暗世界带来了消息
I've returned from the Dark World with news.

985
01:24:49,440 --> 01:24:50,500
托尔吗
Thor?

986
01:24:50,950 --> 01:24:52,650
没见到他
There was no sign of Thor.

987
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,780
也不见那个武器  但是
Or the weapon, but...

988
01:24:57,250 --> 01:24:58,290
怎么了
What?

989
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:02,660
发现了具尸体
We found a body.

990
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:08,820
洛基
Loki.

991
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:14,460
马勒基斯要在
Malekith is going to fire the Aether

992
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:16,990
九大王国汇聚相连的地方发射以太
at the spot where all the nine worlds are connecting.

993
01:25:16,990 --> 01:25:19,210
以增加以太的威力
Amplifying the weapon's impact.

994
01:25:19,630 --> 01:25:23,370
威力随连通的王国数的增加呈指数增长
For each additional world, the power will increase exponentially.

995
01:25:23,370 --> 01:25:25,890
足以波及整个宇宙
The effect would be universal.

996
01:25:26,320 --> 01:25:28,010
但汇聚只会维持很短的时间
Yes, but the Alignment is only temperory,

997
01:25:28,010 --> 01:25:30,910
他必须分秒不差地赶到正确地点
he must be in exactly the right place at the right time.

998
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,600
那正确地点是哪
Well, how do we know where that is?

999
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:35,670
沿着路标走
We follow the directions.

1000
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:39,230
几千年前汇聚也曾发生过
This has happened before, thousands of years ago.

1001
01:25:39,230 --> 01:25:41,120
古人曾亲眼目睹
And the Ancients were there to see it.

1002
01:25:42,030 --> 01:25:43,930
那些了不起的古建筑工程
All the great constructions,

1003
01:25:44,250 --> 01:25:47,320
玛雅人  中国人  古埃及人
the Mayans, the Chinese, the Egyptians.

1004
01:25:47,320 --> 01:25:50,830
都曾利用汇聚对重力的影响
They made use of the gravitational affects of the Convergence.

1005
01:25:50,830 --> 01:25:52,230
这就是我们的地图
And they left us a map.

1006
01:25:52,870 --> 01:25:54,020
巨石阵
Stonehenge.

1007
01:25:55,730 --> 01:25:57,910
斯诺登山  大奥姆岬
Snowdon. Great Orme.

1008
01:25:57,910 --> 01:26:00,210
以他们为坐标  就能找到
These are all coordinates. Taking us...

1009
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:02,780
这里
here.

1010
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:06,130
格林威治
Greenwich.

1011
01:26:06,330 --> 01:26:09,150
九大王国之间的界限将几乎消失
The walls between worlds will almost non-existing,

1012
01:26:09,150 --> 01:26:10,650
物理学定律完全乱套
physics is gonna go ballistic.

1013
01:26:10,650 --> 01:26:12,490
重力忽增忽减
Increases and decreases of gravity,

1014
01:26:12,490 --> 01:26:13,940
空间挤压
spacial extrusions,

1015
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:16,760
现实世界在那里支离破碎
the very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart.

1016
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:21,250
我还是穿上裤子吧
I better get my pants.

1017
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:25,320
集中精神  这可重要了
Focus, this is important.

1018
01:26:25,320 --> 01:26:26,950
我们得先把仪器钉在周围
We had to hammer them in all around the site,

1019
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:29,260
然后简和艾瑞克会在塔上启动
and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.

1020
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:30,690
都绑在一起了
They're taped together.

1021
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,340
你知道这仪器是干什么的吗
Do you even know what these things do?

1022
01:26:34,390 --> 01:26:35,410
不知道
No.

1023
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:37,200
我也不知道
Neither do I.

1024
01:26:45,520 --> 01:26:47,640
-快点  快点  -好吧
- Come on, come on, come on. - Right.

1025
01:27:00,440 --> 01:27:01,650
我...
Holy

1026
01:27:02,020 --> 01:27:02,940
去
shit.

1027
01:28:20,820 --> 01:28:23,380
何必跑这么远  阿斯加德人
You needn't have come so far Asgardian.

1028
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:25,930
死亡很快就要找上门了
Death would've come to you soon enough.

1029
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:27,350
那也不是死在你手上
Not by your hand.

1030
01:28:27,350 --> 01:28:30,500
你们的宇宙就不该存在
Your universe was never meant to be.

1031
01:28:30,500 --> 01:28:35,250
你的王国  你的家人将被彻底消灭
Your world, and your family will be extinguished.

1032
01:28:37,810 --> 01:28:39,200
要没时间了
We're running out of time.

1033
01:28:39,210 --> 01:28:40,300
快了
Almost there.

1034
01:28:40,300 --> 01:28:41,950
这真的能行吗
You sure this is gonna work.

1035
01:28:41,950 --> 01:28:44,970
这仪器是用来检测异常的  而不是引发异常
These devices were made to detect anomalies, not causing them.

1036
01:28:45,460 --> 01:28:46,560
快点
Come on.

1037
01:28:51,790 --> 01:28:52,900
快点  达西
Come on, Darcy.

1038
01:29:03,570 --> 01:29:05,290
你有那么强的力量
You know, with all that power,

1039
01:29:06,250 --> 01:29:07,780
出手怎么这么轻
I thought you'd hit harder.

1040
01:29:32,870 --> 01:29:33,850
好了
Done.

1041
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:43,650
天体汇聚将于7分钟后达到最佳状态
The Convergences will be in full effect in 7 minutes.

1042
01:29:43,650 --> 01:29:46,220
那我们得拖住马勒基斯8分钟
That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for 8.

1043
01:29:52,500 --> 01:29:55,030
好了  你最好扶稳了
Okay, you might want to hold on to something.

1044
01:30:00,510 --> 01:30:03,180
太厉害了  你怎么办到的
That is awesome. How did you do that?

1045
01:30:03,180 --> 01:30:06,830
重力场与各王国之间的薄弱点相互作用
Well, gravitational fields interact with the weak spot between worlds...

1046
01:30:06,830 --> 01:30:08,990
-产生了  -干掉拿剑的那个
- creating... - Get the guy with the sword.

1047
01:30:12,880 --> 01:30:13,860
走吧
Let's go.

1048
01:30:15,630 --> 01:30:17,420
这是怎么回事
What the hell just happened?

1049
01:30:18,580 --> 01:30:19,640
快跑
Move!

1050
01:30:37,140 --> 01:30:38,440
你们干什么呢
What are you all doing?

1051
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,420
赶快出去啊
You need to get out of here. Now.

1052
01:30:40,420 --> 01:30:41,580
你开玩笑呢
You're joking, right?

1053
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:42,770
那可是雷神
That's Thor out there,

1054
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:45,180
还拿着锤子挥来挥去
he's waving his hammer around and everything.

1055
01:32:03,510 --> 01:32:04,840
请确认是否为敌方飞船
Confirming ship is hostile.

1056
01:32:05,070 --> 01:32:06,770
确认为敌方飞船
Confirmed, ship is hostile.

1057
01:32:06,930 --> 01:32:08,550
可以开火
You have permission to engage.

1058
01:32:08,550 --> 01:32:10,770
收到  导弹锁定
Roger, missiles locked.

1059
01:32:11,380 --> 01:32:12,560
导弹已发射
Missiles away.

1060
01:32:14,690 --> 01:32:17,740
导弹偏离目标  重复  偏离目标
Missiles off target. I repeat, target missed.

1061
01:32:17,740 --> 01:32:19,720
我失去控制了  求救  求救
I'm losing control. Mayday. Mayday.

1062
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:21,480
我失去控制了
Lost positive control.

1063
01:32:23,610 --> 01:32:24,680
你干什么
What're you doing?

1064
01:32:24,680 --> 01:32:26,290
信号连不上了
The signal's not connecting.

1065
01:32:28,950 --> 01:32:29,920
简
Jane.

1066
01:32:30,130 --> 01:32:31,100
快跑
Come on.

1067
01:33:13,170 --> 01:33:14,140
你还好吧
Are you all right?

1068
01:33:14,780 --> 01:33:16,200
你救了我
You save my life.

1069
01:33:19,500 --> 01:33:21,650
是啊  没错
Yeah. I guess I did.

1070
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:32,860
-达西  -简
- Darcy? - Jane.

1071
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,400
伊恩
Ian.

1072
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:35,810
塞尔维格
Selvig.

1073
01:33:36,130 --> 01:33:37,170
飞锤
Mew mew!

1074
01:33:40,840 --> 01:33:42,680
注意站台间隙
Mind the gap.

1075
01:33:43,090 --> 01:33:46,010
{\an8}查令十字街站

1076
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:46,390
怎么去格林威治
How do I get to Greenwich?

1077
01:33:47,110 --> 01:33:48,930
上车  坐三站
Take this train, three stops.

1078
01:33:50,970 --> 01:33:52,860
注意站台间隙
Mind the gap.

1079
01:33:55,620 --> 01:33:57,650
抱歉  抱歉
Sorry. Sorry.

1080
01:34:35,120 --> 01:34:36,210
没时间了
We're out of time.

1081
01:34:36,430 --> 01:34:37,400
简
Jane.

1082
01:34:37,910 --> 01:34:38,880
简
Jane.

1083
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:05,990
托尔
Thor.

1084
01:35:07,420 --> 01:35:08,510
太晚了
We're too late.

1085
01:35:09,810 --> 01:35:11,520
天体汇聚已达最佳状态
The Convergence is at its peak.

1086
01:35:12,800 --> 01:35:14,300
这东西能阻止他吗
Can those things stop him?

1087
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:15,290
在这儿不行
Not from here.

1088
01:35:15,300 --> 01:35:16,850
我们没法接近他
We can't get close enough.

1089
01:35:19,160 --> 01:35:20,170
我能
I can.

1090
01:35:45,730 --> 01:35:46,840
马勒基斯
Malekith.

1091
01:35:54,160 --> 01:35:56,780
黑暗回来了  阿斯加德人
Darkness returns, Asgardian.

1092
01:35:57,470 --> 01:36:00,450
你是来看宇宙湮灭的吗
Have you come to witness the end of the universe?

1093
01:36:00,790 --> 01:36:02,980
我是来受降的
I've come to accept your surrender.

1094
01:36:22,490 --> 01:36:24,940
你觉得你能阻止吗
You think you can stop this?

1095
01:36:25,270 --> 01:36:27,840
以太是不可摧毁的
The Aether cannot be destroyed.

1096
01:36:28,140 --> 01:36:29,270
但你不是
But you can.

1097
01:37:15,700 --> 01:37:16,700
托尔
Thor!

1098
01:37:17,200 --> 01:37:17,790
不要
No.

1099
01:37:28,170 --> 01:37:29,130
简
Jane.

1100
01:37:59,470 --> 01:38:00,790
大家还好吧
Everybody okay?

1101
01:38:45,630 --> 01:38:46,940
他会回来的
He's gonna come back.

1102
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,200
就是...
Except, you know...

1103
01:38:51,880 --> 01:38:54,350
上次他一走就是两年
last time he was gone for like two years.

1104
01:38:54,620 --> 01:38:56,770
他才走了两天
Well, it's only been two days, so...

1105
01:38:57,660 --> 01:38:59,760
他走之前说什么了吗
Did he say anything before he left?

1106
01:38:59,890 --> 01:39:02,340
说了  他得跟他父王做些解释
Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father,

1107
01:39:02,350 --> 01:39:04,140
我们逃出来的时候
he kinda committed treason

1108
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:06,130
他犯了叛国罪
on our way out.

1109
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:19,500
你曾说  不会有比我更贤明的君主
You once said, there would never be a wiser king than me.

1110
01:39:19,870 --> 01:39:21,010
你错了
You were wrong.

1111
01:39:21,410 --> 01:39:24,920
九大王国汇聚在一起
The Alignment has broght all the realms together,

1112
01:39:25,470 --> 01:39:28,640
他们都看到你用生命拯救了他们
every one of them saw you offer your life to save them.

1113
01:39:29,140 --> 01:39:33,330
阿斯加德要如何回报它新的国王呢
What can Asgard offer its new king in return?

1114
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:35,950
我的生活
My life.

1115
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,180
父王  我不能做国王
Father I cannot be king of Asgard.

1116
01:39:40,670 --> 01:39:45,390
我会一生竭力保卫九大王国
I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath,

1117
01:39:45,390 --> 01:39:47,400
但坐在王位上可办不到
but I cannot do so from that chair.

1118
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:49,670
洛基虽有不是
Loki, for all his grave imbalance

1119
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:52,300
却懂得一些我永远学不会的道理
understood rule as I know I never will.

1120
01:39:52,970 --> 01:39:55,160
王位所带来的残忍和牺牲
The brutality, the sacrifice.

1121
01:39:55,690 --> 01:39:57,040
会改变一个人
It changes you.

1122
01:39:57,630 --> 01:40:00,410
我宁可做好人  也不愿做明主
I'd rather be a good man, than a great king.

1123
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:05,940
这是我儿子的意愿  还是他爱的女人的意思
Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves.

1124
01:40:06,160 --> 01:40:08,500
我从没觉得是母亲在左右您的决定
When you speak, do I never hear mother's voice.

1125
01:40:10,800 --> 01:40:13,170
我不是为了简  父王
This is not for Jane, father.

1126
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:15,630
她不知道我要来说什么
She does not know what I came here to say.

1127
01:40:16,210 --> 01:40:17,630
禁止我见她
Now, forbid me to see her,

1128
01:40:17,630 --> 01:40:20,580
或是同意她与我共同治国  都无济于事
or say she can rule by my side, it changes nothing.

1129
01:40:21,330 --> 01:40:24,140
一个儿子太过渴求王位
One son who wanted the throne too much,

1130
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,560
另一个却弃之而去
another who will not take it.

1131
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:30,150
这就是我留给后世的吗
Is this my legacy?

1132
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:31,860
洛基光荣牺牲
Loki died with honor.

1133
01:40:32,600 --> 01:40:35,570
我也要尽力而为  这还不够吗
I shall try to live the same, is that not legacy enough?

1134
01:40:46,550 --> 01:40:48,170
只要你配得上它
It belongs to you

1135
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:51,450
它就是你的
if you're worthy of it.

1136
01:40:51,660 --> 01:40:52,940
我会尽力的
I shall try to.

1137
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,450
我不能祝福你
I cannot give you my blessing,

1138
01:40:58,300 --> 01:41:00,300
也不能祝你好运
nor can I wish you good fortune.

1139
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:02,110
我知道
I know.

1140
01:41:05,700 --> 01:41:08,860
即使我为我儿子如今的为人而骄傲
If I were proud of the man my son had become,

1141
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:11,530
我也不能说出来
even that, I could not say.

1142
01:41:14,620 --> 01:41:17,350
但我会在心里赞许你
It would speak only from my heart.

1143
01:41:19,280 --> 01:41:20,330
去吧
Go.

1144
01:41:21,780 --> 01:41:22,890
我的儿子
My son.

1145
01:41:25,380 --> 01:41:26,590
谢谢  父王
Thank you, father.

1146
01:41:42,310 --> 01:41:43,290
不
No.

1147
01:41:44,600 --> 01:41:45,760
该谢谢你
Thank you.

1148
01:43:49,120 --> 01:43:52,580
{\an5}雷神2

1149
01:43:49,990 --> 01:43:52,580
{\an5}黑暗世界

1150
01:44:04,680 --> 01:44:06,650
向二位介绍
I present to you

1151
01:44:07,370 --> 01:44:10,790
收藏者坦利亚·蒂万
Taneleer Tivan, the Collector.

1152
01:44:16,860 --> 01:44:20,510
阿斯加德人  真是荣幸
Asgardians. It's an honor.

1153
01:44:24,970 --> 01:44:26,620
你知道我们为何而来
You know why we're here.

1154
01:44:30,740 --> 01:44:32,340
是的
Of course.

1155
01:44:33,540 --> 01:44:35,460
但容我问一句
But if I may ask.

1156
01:44:35,860 --> 01:44:39,910
为什么不保管在你们那儿呢
Why not keep it secure in your own vault?

1157
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,370
宇宙魔方已经在阿斯加德了
The Tesseract is already on Asgard.

1158
01:44:43,000 --> 01:44:46,630
不该把两颗无限宝石放得太近
It's not wise to keep two Infinity Stone so close together.

1159
01:44:47,130 --> 01:44:49,260
很明智
That's very wise.

1160
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:01,290
我保证
I can assure you

1161
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:07,780
在我手里
it will be absolutely safe here

1162
01:45:09,540 --> 01:45:11,260
一定万无一失
in my collection.

1163
01:45:13,320 --> 01:45:14,820
务必保管好
See that it is.

1164
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:35,900
一个拿到
One down,

1165
01:45:38,150 --> 01:45:39,760
还剩五个
five to go.

1166
01:51:53,640 --> 01:51:57,440
{\an5}{\pos(194,119)}雷神还将回归
